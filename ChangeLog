qpwgraph - A PipeWire Graph Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

ChangeLog


GIT HEAD

- Patchbay node-name persistence is now made uniform and generic
  for most if not all multimedia players (eg. web browsers) that
  usually tend to power-cycle their PipeWire client/driver on a
  whim (eg. pause, skip,... whatever) (EXPERIMENTAL)


0.9.0  2025-04-25  A Spring'25 Beta Release.

- Mitigate an alternate re-positioning to some application nodes
  (eg. Discord) on each screen refresh (F5).

0.8.3  2025-03-28  An Early Spring'25 Beta Release.

- Loading a patchbay profile (*.qpwgraph) from the command line,
  is now properly shown on the main window title and toolbar.
- Added PipeWire command line version information.


0.8.2  2025-03-07  An End-of-Winter'25 Beta Release.

- Port colors: new PipeWire MIDI 2 (UMP) port type is now aliased
  to the same as (now old) MIDI port type. (pipewire >= 1.3.81)

  exiting the application with a segfault when showing help and
  version information.

  context-menu.


0.8.0  2024-11-14  A Mid-Autumn'24 Beta Release.

  the currently loaded patchbay, allowing the removal and cleanup

- Introducing the new Graph/Options... dialog, to where the most
  general option settings have been (re)moved from the main Help

0.7.9  2024-10-28  An Autumn'24 Beta Release.

- Thumb-view: Fixed flicker when dragging widget from top to

  node and reusing a previous port id.

  an old undefined behavior to positioning and Patchbay persistence
  of multiple nodes with the very same and exact name.

  critical section, hopefully preventing the race-conditions that
  are the suspected cause to some rare crashes.

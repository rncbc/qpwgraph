qpwgraph - A PipeWire Graph Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------------

ChangeLog


0.9.7  2025-11-14  An Autumn'25 Beta Release.

- Add topological sort node arrangement (cf. View/Arrange Nodes;
  by Mike Bourgeous)


0.9.6  2025-10-06  An Early-Fall'25 Beta Release.

- Allow the complete node name to get the same treatment in the
  Graph/Options.../Filter as same for Merger.

- Get rid of CONFIG_WAYLAND build config option; add underlying
  platform name (eg. xcb, wayland) to Qt version string.


0.9.5  2025-08-15  A Mid-Summer'25 Beta Release.

- Make all node-names in merger list (Graph/Options.../Merger)
  implicitly exclusive for Patchbay persistence.

- Cope with in-flight node/port count changing.


0.9.4  2025-06-21  An Early-Summer'25 Beta Release.

- Indulged on a new 'Add' (pinned connection) button into the
  Patchbay/Manage... dialog also make dialog size and position
  persistent.
- Introducing Graph/Options.../Merger to unify node-names for
  Patchbay persistence, especially useful to PipeWire clients
  that spawn more than one node, having the very same name (eg.
  web browsers).


0.9.3  2025-06-02  An End-of-Spring'25 Beta Release.

- Corrected (again) salvage of node positions that possible have
  the very same and exact name.


0.9.2  2025-05-17  A Mid-Spring'25 Hot-Fix Beta Release.

- Save node positions as soon as they are taken or moved around,
  avoiding accidental re-positioning to the previous or original
  state.

- Regression to the late uniform and generic patchbay node-names
  which was a terrible mistake: while it sort of fixed some issues
  regarding multimedia players, it sent all other cases bonkers.
  So sorry for all the foul play or inconvenience.


0.9.1  2025-05-15  A Mid-Spring'25 Beta Release.

- Patchbay node-name persistence is now made uniform and generic
  for most if not all multimedia players (eg. web browsers) that
  usually tend to power-cycle their PipeWire client/driver on a
  whim (eg. pause, skip,... whatever)


0.9.0  2025-04-25  A Spring'25 Beta Release.

- Mitigate an alternate re-positioning to some application nodes
  (eg. Discord) on each screen refresh (F5).
- Stepping up next development cycle (Qt >= 6.9)


0.8.3  2025-03-28  An Early Spring'25 Beta Release.

- Loading a patchbay profile (*.qpwgraph) from the command line,
  is now properly shown on the main window title and toolbar.

0.8.2  2025-03-07  An End-of-Winter'25 Beta Release.

- Port colors: new PipeWire MIDI 2 (UMP) port type is now aliased
  to the same as (now old) MIDI port type. (pipewire >= 1.3.81)
- Fixed command line parsing (QCommandLineParser/Option) to not
  exiting the application with a segfault when showing help and
  version information.

  the currently loaded patchbay, allowing the removal and cleanup
  of connection rules that are no longer used, obsolete or simply
  not applicable anymore.
- Force an actual complete graph refresh on main View/Refresh...
- Introducing the new Graph/Options... dialog, to where the most
  general option settings have been (re)moved from the main Help
  menu.

  pattern (blacklist).
- Fix default PipeWire node nickname if given empty.


0.7.9  2024-10-28  An Autumn'24 Beta Release.

  an old undefined behavior to positioning and Patchbay persistence
  of multiple nodes with the very same and exact name.
- Fixed the main PipeWire registry thread-safety, into a two-level
  critical section, hopefully preventing the race-conditions that
  are the suspected cause to some rare crashes.
